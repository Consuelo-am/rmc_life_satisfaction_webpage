**GOAL**: Use R to replicate [this set of interactive tables and charts](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder){target="_blank"} from Our World in Data on life satisfaction across countries.


```{r include = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

# Load packages 
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(plotly, tidyverse, reactable, here, scales)
```

<!-- Custom HTML to add logo -->
<img src="Our_World_in_Data_logo.png" style='width: 100px; position:absolute; top:0; right:0; padding:10px;'/>

```{r}
## Import data
cantril <- 
  read_csv(here("data/happiness-cantril-ladder.csv")) %>% 
  rename(Country = Entity)
```


# Self-reported life satisfaction, 2011 to 2022

“Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”

# {.tabset}

## 🔢 Table

TABLE TO BE CREATED HERE

```{r}
# In this tab, you will need to create a table with the following columns: 
# Country, `2011`, `2022`, Absolute change, and Relative change.

# NEATER VERSION OF THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS
# You should:
# 1. Use `select` to drop the Code column from the `cantril` data as it is not needed in the table.
# 2. Filter the `cantril` data frame to just the years 2011 and 2022.
# 3. Use the `pivot_wider` function to create the columns for 2011 and 2022.
# (You may need backticks around column names with spaces or which start with numbers.)
# 4. Use the `mutate` function to calculate the Absolute change and Relative change.
# 5. Also with `mutate`, you should round your numbers to appropriate decimal places.
# 6. Then use scales::percent to format the Relative change as a percentage.
# 7. Use the `reactable` function to create and output the table.
```


## 🌎 Map

```{r}
# This code is already done for you. You don't need to change anything here. 
# But if you change any of the column names, or something else with the data,
# you may need to adjust the code below.
cantril %>% 
  mutate(`Cantril ladder score` = round(`Cantril ladder score`, 2)) %>%
  plotly::plot_geo(width = 940) %>% 
  add_trace(
    z = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
    color = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
    locations = ~Code,
    text = ~Country,
    frame = ~Year, colors = "YlGn"
  ) %>% 
  colorbar(title = NULL)
```


## 📈 Simple Chart

CHART TO BE CREATED HERE 

```{r}
# In this tab, create a simple line chart of the Cantril score over time for a few countries.
# You should follow these steps:
# 1. Filter the cantril data to just 4 to 8 countries you want to highlight
# 2. Use ggplot to create a line chart of the Cantril score over time, with different colors for each country
# 3. Use geom_line to create the lines
# 4. Use scale_y_continuous to set the y-axis limits to 0 and 10.
# 5. Use labs to create neat labels for the chart
# 6. Use theme_minimal to set the theme.
# 7. Finally, use ggplotly to convert the ggplot chart to a plotly chart
```

## 📈 Advanced Chart

One problem with the simple chart on the previous tab is that the countries are fixed. It would be better if the user could select the countries they want to see. This is not possible with `plotly` alone, but with the `crosstalk` package and some custom JavaScript, we can achieve this, as demonstrated below.

This is simply a demonstration for you, you do not need to work on this for your assignment. You may want to come back to this when you need such functionality in your own projects.

For more information on how we achieved this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).


```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk, plotly)

# Crosstalk shared data object
# This allows the filter to interact with the plot
shared_cantril_data <- highlight_key(cantril)

cantril_plotly <- plot_ly(
  shared_cantril_data, 
  x = ~Year, 
  y = ~`Cantril ladder score`, 
  color = ~Country, 
  type = "scatter", 
  mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0, 10)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
  "country_filter", 
  "Select a country to examine", 
  shared_cantril_data, 
  ~Country, 
  multiple = TRUE
)

# Output the filter and the plot
bscols(
  list(country_filter, cantril_plotly)
)
```

<!-- Custom javascript to set default values in the filter: -->
<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Bhutan"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>
