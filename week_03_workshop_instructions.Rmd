## Workshop Goal

Our goal is to use R to replicate [this set of interactive tables and charts](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder){target="_blank"} from Our World in Data on life satisfaction.

Our World in Data creates gold-standard visualizations and data analysis. They provide a wealth of data on global trends and long-term changes.

## Getting Started

- Fork, then clone this repository: [https://github.com/the-graph-courses/rmc_life_satisfaction_webpage](https://github.com/the-graph-courses/rmc_life_satisfaction_webpage){target="_blank"}.
- Open the `index.Rmd` file. This file contains the skeleton for your assignment.
- Follow the instructions to complete the "Table" and "Simple Chart" tabs.

## Submission

- When finished, render your HTML, push your changes to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages for the repository. 
- Submit the link to the deployed website (the link will probably look something like this: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/NAME_OF_YOUR_REPO/`). Make sure it works before submitting.
